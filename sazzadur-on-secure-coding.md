**Title:** Principles and Practices to Write Secure code

**Abstract:**

Java platform provides various features to conveniently enable application-level security. For example, Java Cryptographic Architecture (JCA) offers functionalities for hashes, key generations, certificates, digital signatures, and encryption. Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) includes APIs for standard secure communication protocols like SSL/TLS. Spring security offers *ready-to-use* authentication and authorization modules. However, misusing these libraries and frameworks seriously undermines application security.

In this talk, I will discuss common security API misuses and framework misconfigurations that I observed during my research in software security. I will also talk about some possible reasons behind these issues and how to avoid them.

**Track:** Security; Secure coding;

**Experience Level for the Target Audience:** Beginners
