# Grokking the Asynchronous and Non-Blocking Reactive Microservice Development with Vert.x

## Abstract

While the traditional model of synchronous programming and threading model has the simplicity of development, it cause waste of resources (memory & CPU) due to the way it handle blocking I/O & network operation and doesn't scale very well. Reactive systems have emerged in response to the increasing need of highly-available elastic applications, which have shown the limits of classic threaded systems. Vert.x is a JVM toolkit that can be used to build reactive systems. It can deal with more concurrent network connections with less threads than synchronous APIs based framework like Spring/JavaEE.

In this talk, I will discuss the concept behind event driven and non blocking development model and how Vert.x offer to develop reactive microservice in easy way.
